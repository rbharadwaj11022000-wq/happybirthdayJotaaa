                    <h3>My Dearest Jotaaa,</h3>
                    <p>Happy Birthday to you, my love! 🎉 If I had a star for every reason you make me smile, I’d have a whole galaxy—though none would shine as bright as you today ✨</p>
                    <p>To be frank, I overreact most of the times when you are busy with something. The only reason for that is I'm so attached to you. After my mother, you're the only other person with whom I am very genuine and real—I can share everything and anything. Even from Appa, I hide a few things. So I feel you're the only one I truly have 🥺. If I don’t talk or text, I start feeling lonely.Emotionally so much dependent on you.And unlike you-you have your friends,cousins,aache friends-with whom you can share things.Nange irodhu oble.So adukke hange swalpa psych madthini (cute psych aytha?) 😬. Inhted yest kaata kotru, for once also you have never lost your shit (I know the day you lose, straight to hospital naanu 😂). You're always calmly trying to explain things to me, whereas I act like a stubborn kid who never listens 🙃.</p>
                    <p>I am super boastful about having the prettiest girlfriend. Some might say a mismatch, but I don’t give a fuck 😂. I truly got the most beautiful-looking girlfriend. Seriously, I fell for you at first look, and obviously, later, I loved the person herself. Usually, I'm like that—if I like something, I make sure I end up getting it—idrallu hange adre saaku 🙏. Again, I ask myself, how did I pull this off? 😂 Aren’t you too good for me? I still feel 'yes' in every aspect.</p>
                    <p>BTW, I lost interest in every other girl since I am with you. Idh yav sexual category ge baruthe? 😂</p>
                    <p>And you don’t need to worry about the future. I am sure I’ll succeed, ast confidence idhe 😂. I just want you to be by my side forever—from when I had nothing to when I have everything.</p>
                    <p>I have cried thinking about you, and I have smiled thinking about you. I want you for life, but I also have the biggest fear: what if I lose you? I just don’t want to think about that. I’ve tried every possible thing to make you feel special; I don’t know yestru matige you have been impressed, but I have tried.I have really really tried hard to make you feel special.Disappointed you number of times,hurt you so many times-Really sorry for that.I'll make sure that I change myself-never ever disappoint you-Big promise.Whenever I pray, I always ask God for us. I just want you in my life forever.I still can’t get dreams, so I started daydreaming about you and me together… I remember saying to Prashasth, "It’s gonna be one girl, and she’ll be the only one."</p>
                    <p>I don’t know how much of a match I am for you, but for me, I feel you're the special one.I may have had doubts before, but now I’m certain — no one will ever love you as deeply and unconditionally as I do. I promise to keep putting in my best every day, to always find little ways to make you smile, and to keep falling in love with you over and over again.From birthday wishes, this became more of a proposal 🙃.</p>
                    <p class="poem">
                        You’re my happiness… yet sometimes the reason for my tears.<br>
                        You’re my strength… yet sometimes the weakness I can’t hide.<br>
                        You make me smile so wide… yet sometimes you’re the reason my eyes shine with sadness.<br>
                        You’re my peace, yet sometimes the storm in my heart.<br>
                        My reason to hold on, yet sometimes the reason I lie awake at night.<br>
                        You’re my sweetest comfort, yet also the ache I can’t let go of.<br>
                        You’re my forever dream… yet sometimes the most beautiful mystery I’ll never fully understand.<br>
                        And through it all — the smiles, the tears, the calm, the storms — you are still my person, my heart, my always. ❤️
                    </p>
                    <p>Once again, happy birthday, gorgeous! They say the best things in life are free… so how come I had to work so hard to win you? 😉❤️</p>
